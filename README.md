This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Carry Me Frontend
## About this app
When people play multiplayer games, whenever someone is looking for someone else to play with, gamers post on forums, facebook groups, and reddit. The problem with that is that its super unorganized because the older posts become hidden and covered up by the newer posts.

My idea was to do a "tinder" style app in which users can swipe like/pass on each "post"/user; so, every post isn't lost or covered up despite the age of the post.

Another thing is that the gaming community is notorious for being angry, toxic, and filled with "trolls". So, my app also has a "yelp"-like feature, where you can leave anonymous reviews on players, which gets calculated into an overall rating.

This game is focused on the game Fortnite. Users must have an existing account with Fortnite/Epic Games to use. 

### Future Plans
I wanted a realtime database; so, if I were to do this project differently, I would've carefully planned out more about what technologies to use. Also, my app is only for 1 game, Fortnite. In the future, I want to open it up to more games.



## Backend
The backend is a Flask API server, python with a SQL database. Here is the backend repo: [Here!](https://github.com/dawong8/carry-me-backend)

## Features

* view daily Fortnite item shop

* message/view messages
* leave reviews
